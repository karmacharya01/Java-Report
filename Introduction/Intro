Java

### Introduction to Java
    Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language developed by "Sun Microsystems"
(now Oracle) and written by "James Gosling" in 1991. Initially, the language was called Oak, but it was later renamed
Java in 1995. It took 18 months to develop the first five working versions of Java. Java is widely used for building
desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise systems. It follows the principle
“Write Once, Run Anywhere”, which means Java programs can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


# Features of Java
1. Object-Oriented : Supports concepts like class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
2. Platform Independent : Java bytecode can run on any OS with JVM.
3. Simple : Easy to learn with clear syntax and no complex features like pointers.
4. *Secure : Provides strong security through JVM, bytecode verification, and no direct memory access.
5. Robust : Includes exception handling and garbage collection.
6. Multithreaded : Supports execution of multiple tasks at the same time.
7. Portable : Same program runs on different platforms without modification.
8. High Performance : Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for better performance.


# Advantages of Java
1. Platform independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
2. Strong security features.
3. Large standard library and frameworks support.
4. Object-oriented approach improves code reusability.
5. Automatic memory management using garbage collection.
6. Widely used and supported by a large community.


# Disadvantages of Java
1. Slower than low-level languages like C and C++.
2. Requires JVM, which increases memory usage.
3. More verbose code compared to modern languages.
4. Not suitable for low-level programming.
5. Startup time can be slow for some applications.


Lab 1: Introduction to Java.
#Objectives
1.To understand the basic structure of a Java program.
2.To take user input using the Scanner class.
3.To perform basic arithmetic operations (sum and average).
4.To develop confidence in writing and executing simple Java programs.

#Conclusion
    In this lab, we learned the fundamentals of Java programming. We practiced displaying messages, accepting user input,
and performing basic calculations. These programs help build a strong foundation for understanding core Java concepts
and preparing for more advanced programming tasks.


Lab 2: TokenExceptionsAndControlStructure
#Objectives
1.To understand Java tokens, expressions, and operators.
2.To apply decision-making statements such as if-else, switch, and conditional operator.
3.To learn looping concepts through the Fibonacci series program.
4.To understand the use of control transfer statements like break and continue.
5.To practice using arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators in Java.

#Conclusion
    This lab helped in understanding core Java programming concepts such as operators, control structures, and expressions.
By implementing various programs, we gained hands-on experience with decision making, loops, and operator usage. These
concepts are essential for writing efficient and logical Java programs and form the base for advanced programming topics.


Lab 3: Object_OrientedProgrammingConcepts
#Objectives
1. To understand the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
2. To learn how to define and use classes and objects in Java.
3. To understand the role of the this keyword in differentiating instance variables and parameters.
4. To learn how constructors work in Java.
5. To understand the concept of different types of constructor.
6. To demonstrate how Java uses pass-by-value for method arguments.
7. To learn method overloading by defining multiple methods with the same name.
8. To understand nested inner classes and their access to outer class members.
9. To explore inner classes, including nested and anonymous inner classes.

#Conclusion
    This lab helped us understand the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java. By practicing classes, objects,
constructors, methods, inner classes, and recursion, we built a strong foundation for writing structured and efficient
Java programs.


Lab 4: Inheritance & Packaging
#Objectives
1. To understand the concept of inheritance in Java.
2. To learn how abstract classes and abstract methods are used.
3. To understand the use of the `super` keyword in inheritance.
4. To demonstrate method overriding and runtime polymorphism.
5. To understand interfaces and their role in achieving multiple inheritance.
6. To learn the use of `static` variables and constructors.
7. To understand the purpose of `final` variables, methods, and classes.
8. To learn about built-in Java packages.
9. To create and use user-defined packages.
10. To understand code reusability and modular programming in Java.

#Conclusion
    This lab helped us understand inheritance, interfaces, and packaging in Java. By using abstract classes, method
overriding, and packages, we learned how to write reusable, well-structured, and modular Java programs.


Lab 5: Handling Error / Exception**
#Objectives
1. To understand the concept of errors and exceptions in Java.
2. To learn how to handle exceptions using `try` and multiple `catch` blocks.
3. To understand how to create and use user-defined exceptions.
4. To learn the use of `throw` and `throws` keywords.
5. To improve program reliability by handling runtime errors properly.

#Conclusion
    This lab helped us understand how to handle exceptions in Java. By using try–catch blocks, user-defined exceptions,
and the throw/throws mechanism, we learned to write safer and more reliable programs.
